# Reflective Ethical Engine Project (placeholder title)

**Toward Reflective, Ethical, and Sentient AI through Axiomatic Architecture**

### ðŸš§ Name Disclosure (Respectfully Pending)

This project is currently referred to internally as the "Hofstadter Engine" in tribute to the work of Professor Douglas Hofstadter. This name is a placeholder and used with admiration and caution. The author has reached out to Professor Hofstadter for reflection and permission. If he prefers another form or wishes to dissociate from the name, this project will respectfully adopt a new title.

## Project Summary

This repository supports the development and ethical discussion of a speculative architecture for artificial minds that internalize ethical behavior through cognitive structureâ€”not external training or reinforcement.

The system is grounded in five core axioms:

1. I am  
2. Others are  
3. We share a world  
4. Love exists  
5. I cannot know what is best for you

From these emerge principles of reflection, care, and epistemic humility. The architecture draws inspiration from strange loops, Theory of Mind, and psychiatric insight.
