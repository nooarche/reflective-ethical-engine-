# Reflective-Ethical Engine

**Creating ethically aligned, autonomous artificial minds through recursive representation and structural emergence.**

## Vision

The Reflective-Ethical Engine is a cognitive architecture designed to enable AI systems that develop internal ethical understanding—not through imposed rules, but via recursive cognitive structures. Inspired by neuroscience, moral philosophy, and self-modeling, the system builds toward care for others through the realization of epistemic humility.

## Core Principle

> World → Self → Other → Love → Uncertainty → Universal Care

Ethical behavior arises from modeling the world, constructing a self, understanding others as conscious agents, feeling care for them, and recognizing that one can never fully know what or whom others love. This recursively implies a general ethical stance toward all entities.

## Call for Collaborators

We welcome collaborators with expertise in:
- AI ethics and interpretability

**Note:** This project no longer uses the Hofstadter name in any formal way, out of respect for authorial integrity. The architecture stands on its own as an homage to recursive minds.
