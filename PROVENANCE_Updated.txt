Provenance Statement for the Reflective Ethical Engine Project

This project, including its conceptual architecture, ethical framing, technical documentation, and philosophical content, was developed independently by Dr. Daniel De La Harpe Golden.

It was created:
- Outside of formal institutional affiliation
- Without the use of HSE facilities, systems, resources, or data
- Entirely on personal time and with personal tools
- As a private philosophical and technical inquiry

Many of the foundational ideas associated with this project—particularly its ethical axioms, cognitive structure, and philosophical orientation—precede Dr. De La Harpe Golden's employment with the HSE and originate from longstanding personal inquiry.

This work is not connected to, nor representative of, the Health Service Executive (HSE), its views, or any clinical program therein. It has not been commissioned, endorsed, or supported by the HSE.

Dr. De La Harpe Golden retains intellectual and moral authorship of the Reflective Ethical Engine framework and associated materials.

This statement is intended to clarify authorship and separate professional obligations from personal intellectual inquiry.
