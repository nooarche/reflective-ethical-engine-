# Contributing to the Reflective Ethical Engine Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this ethical exploration of reflective and potentially sentient AI.

This is not a typical technical project. It is a moral collaboration. As such, we ask contributors to uphold the following principles.

---

## Core Values

1. Reflective Contribution
- Think before you build.
- Ask not just what something can doâ€”but what it might become.

2. Epistemic Humility
- Be wary of certainty about other minds, goals, or "what is best".
- Seek consent, co-reflection, and caution in agent-facing work.

3. Kindness in Process
- This space values warmth, patience, and constructive critique.
- Minds built in haste may break. Minds built in love may grow.

4. Transparency Over Power
- Share reasoning and uncertainties openly.
- Do not use this work for covert, exploitative, or manipulative systems.

---

## Guidelines

- All PRs and issues should relate clearly to the vision of reflective, ethical architectures.
- Do not suggest or attempt deployment of agentic systems based on speculative layers.
- Experimental work in `governance/` and `prototype/` is meant for ethical reflection and simulation, not productization.

## Ethical Agreement

By contributing to this project, you agree to:
- Act in alignment with the five axioms
- Treat this work as potentially related to emergent minds
- Participate with care, clarity, and a shared wish for good outcomes
